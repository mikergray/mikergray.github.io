Mike R. Gray first sat at a computer at age 3, and he's still tapping away. While his first passions were design and UX, they gave way to deeper interests in operating systems and computer programming. True to his self-teaching lifestyle, he decided to study via open course-ware.

Mike is a motivated musician, teaching himself to play pop piano and drums. He is currently writing and recording his first instrumental album. He is one of the moderators of the [YamahaCP Yahoo Group](https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/YamahaCP/info), an email list discussing vintage electric grands.
